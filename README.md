# amino_acid_1.0
This is my first repository for following the GitHub guide
I'm SemaDR by name.
This repos mainly is created to help me get familiar with the GitHub development features.
However, it contains the Flutter Mobile Application I built to incorporate an Amino Acid Synthesis in Biochemistry.
This build is still in progress.
